    <h2>The Humanities</h2>
    <p>The English language makes a distinction between &ldquo;science&rdquo;
      and the &ldquo;humanities&rdquo;, thereby implying that the humanities
      are not true sciences.
      This opposition is often expressed as a distinction between 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science">hard and
      soft science</a> or, as in C. P. Snow's famous book,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures" 
      class="booktitle">The Two Cultures</a> (1959).
      Other languages do not make this distinction and
      give the study of literature, linguistics, music <abbr>etc.</abbr>
      names that include a word for science. These disciplines are collectively
      known as
      <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisteswissenschaft" 
      lang="de">Geisteswissenschaft(en)</a> in German,
      <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanidades"
      lang="es">humanidades</a> in Spanish and
      <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfawetenschappen"
      lang="nl">alfawetenschappen</a> in Dutch.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>The humanities (which are usually considered to include philosophy) 
      have come under pressure after sciences like physics became
      the model for scientific progress in general.
      Recent examples include the 
      <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/10/04/albany">disappearance of language departments at State University of New York at Albany</a>
      in 2010 and the 
      <a href="http://savemdxphil.com/about/">closing of the Philosophy Department at Middlesex University</a>.
      Some people have reacted to this by pointing out the value of the humanities to society.
      The British philosopher 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._C._Grayling">A. C. Grayling</a>
      responded by founding the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College_of_the_Humanities">New
      College of the Humanities</a> in London, which started offering tuition
      in 2012.

    <p>Introductions to literary criticism:</p>

      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIlatssdqY5Na_a9r-_Hl1SGmK5M3HJGv">Literary Criticism</a>
        is a YouTube playlist created by Tim Nance. It contains a handful of videos that introduces
        major types of literary criticism (New Criticism, Reader Response, Historical Criticism, etcetera).
      </li>
      <li>Marc Baldwin:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmRMjCfLEtA">The Basics of Literary Criticism</a> (13 minutes) and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6ixulYPtYg">The Major Theories of Literary Criticism</a> (22 minutes)
        are two short lectures.
        In the first video, Marc Baldwin says,
        <q>I've noticed through the years that when many of my students don't like a work of literature or they call it boring,
        what they really mean is that they didn't fully appreciate what the writer was doing. They didn't really understand the work.
        Having a grounding in critical theory can help you better understand and appreciate what you're reading.</q>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD00D35CBC75941BD">Introduction to Theory of Literature with Paul H. Fry</a>
        is a series of 26 videos that gives an overview of twentieth-century literary criticism.
        They are based on a series of lectures recorded in 2009 at Yale University 
        (see the description on <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300">Open Yale courses</a>).
        Each video is between 40 and 55 minutes long.

    <p>People sometimes ask why we need literary theory. Here is one answer (posted on a mailing list in 18 September 1995):</p>
    <blockquote><p>My short (perhaps equally naive) answer to a very complex question is 
      that literary theory (<abbr>l.t.</abbr>) is a body of (more or less coherent) 
      assumptions about what literature is, how and why to read and study it. 
      These very general theoretical postulates can then be applied to/on 
      different levels of the study of literature.</p>
    <p>Looking at it in practical terms, literary theory more or less tries to 
      theorize and systematize the conceptual frameworks shared by different 
      (Western) literatures, like "poetic language", "poetry", "sonnet", 
      "novel", "stream of consciousness", "metre", "character", "Modernism", 
      "literary period", "literary history", "interpretation", etc.

    </blockquote>
    <p>Here is another point of view, from the blurb of Catherine Belsey's book 
      <i class="booktitle">Shakespeare in Theory and Practice</i> (Edinburgh University Press, 2010):
    </p>
    <blockquote><p>Theory is valuable to the degree that it enables us to read differently: 
      a nuanced approach shows that the most obvious interpretation is never the whole story.</p>

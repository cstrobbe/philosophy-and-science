      <h2>The Humanities</h2>
      <p>The English language makes a distinction between &ldquo;science&rdquo;
        and the &ldquo;humanities&rdquo;, thereby implying that the humanities
        are not true sciences.
        This opposition is often expressed as a distinction between
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science">hard and
        soft science</a> or, as in C. P. Snow's famous lecture,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures"
        class="booktitle">The Two Cultures</a> (1959).
        Other languages do not make this distinction and
        give the study of literature, linguistics, music <abbr>etc.</abbr>
        names that include a word for science. These disciplines are collectively
        known as
        <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisteswissenschaft"
        lang="de">Geisteswissenschaft(en)</a> in German,
        <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanidades"
        lang="es">humanidades</a> in Spanish and
        <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfawetenschappen"
        lang="nl">alfawetenschappen</a> in Dutch.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>The humanities (which are usually considered to include philosophy)
        have come under pressure after sciences like physics became
        the model for scientific progress in general.
        Recent examples include the
        <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/10/04/albany">disappearance of language departments at State University of New York at Albany</a>
        in 2010 and the
        <a href="http://savemdxphil.com/about/">closing of the Philosophy Department at Middlesex University</a>.
        Some people have reacted to this by pointing out the value of the humanities to society.
        The British philosopher
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._C._Grayling">A. C. Grayling</a>
        responded by founding the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College_of_the_Humanities">New
        College of the Humanities</a> in London, which started offering tuition
        in 2012.
        <!--@@more about NCH: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=grayling+found+humanities+london -->

          <br />In his <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1998-07-01/who-killed-homer-demise-classical-education-and-recovery-greek">&ldquo;capsule review&rdquo;</a>
          in <i class="magazine">Foreign Affairs</i>, Francis Fukuyma writes:
          <q>Although ostensibly focused on the narrow issue of the decline of classics as an academic discipline and as a subject of study in American universities, this book is really about the loss of a common, humanistic core in contemporary education and culture.
          (&hellip;) Genuine recovery of that tradition requires more than defense against varied feminists and deconstructionists; it means a thorough rethinking of the modern Enlightenment project itself.</q>
          <br />From <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/victor-davis-hanson/who-killed-homer/">Kirkus Revie</a>:
          <q>Hanson and Heath are not so much right-wing revisionists as passionate Hellenists whose belief in Greece and Rome's central role in Western civilization is fervent and articulate.
          Writing against the multicultural grain, they stress the unique aspects of Greek and Roman society, e.g., the idea of open dissent in the polis and the concept of civilian militias and citizen-soldiers, and maintain the continued importance of The Iliad and The Odyssey. Their rigorous pedagogic program for returning Classics to a pride of place in the humanities, however, involves too many Draconian measures--scrapping the doctoral dissertation, ending post-doc fellowships, junking peer conference junkets--to be practical. An elegy that slaughters a hecatomb of sacred cows along the way.</q>

          <br />From the publisher's book description:
          <q>(&hellip;) Eaglestone shows that studying literature can change who you are, turning you from a ‘reader’ into a ‘critic’: someone attuned to the ways we make meaning in our world.
          Literature is a living conversation which provides endless opportunities to rethink and reinterpret our societies and ourselves. With examples ranging from Sappho to Skyrim, this book shows how literature offers freer and deeper ways of thinking and being.</q>

          <a href="https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509517923"><abbr>ISBN</abbr> 9781509517930</a>.
          <br />From the publisher's book description:
          <q>For generations, the study of Greek and Latin was used to train the elites of the western world. Knowledge of classical culture, it was believed, produced more cultivated, creative individuals;
          Greece and Rome were seen as pinnacles of civilization, and the origins of western superiority over the rest of the world.
          <br />Few today are willing to defend this elitist, sometimes racist, vision of the importance of classics, and it is no longer considered essential education for politicians and professionals. Shouldn’t classics then be obsolete?
          <br />Far from it. As Neville Morley shows, the ancients are as influential today as they ever have been, and we ignore them at our peril.
          Not only do they have much to teach us about the past, but they can offer important lessons for the complex cultural, social and political worlds of the present.

          (<i class="ytchannel">University of Birmingham</i> on YouTube, 18.10.2018, 42 minutes).
          Video recording of a talk by Professor Martin Willis, Cardiff University,
          at the University of Birmingham on 17 October 2018.
          The video is always available on the website of
          <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/liberal-arts-and-sciences/events/2018/martin-willis.aspx"
          title="What role do the humanities play in our scientific world?">school or department of Liberal Arts and Natural Sciences (<abbr>LANS</abbr>)</a>.
          The lecture's abstract goes as follows:
          <blockquote>The relationship between the humanities and the sciences often has the hallmarks of melodrama: one is forever falling out of love with the other, or entering into a crisis of faith about their ongoing suitability.
            In this lecture I want to examine the long history of this relationship, highlighting those key moments where the disciplines have successfully combined as well as moments of disruption and conflict. Looking backwards, across 200 years, will enable me to consider their present interdisciplinary relationship and ask what the future holds for collaborative success.
            This is a story that will take me from Frankenstein to Futurology, during which we will encounter the key protagonists in what might be described as a battle to define truth and evidence.

      <h2 id="dead-poets-society">Dead Poets Society and the Humanities</h2>
      <p>The film <i class="film">Dead Poets Society</i> sparked comments about the humanites and how to teach them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dettmar, Kevin J. H.:
          <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/02/-em-dead-poets-society-em-is-a-terrible-defense-of-the-humanities/283853/">Dead Poets Society Is a Terrible Defense of the Humanities</a>,
          <i class="magazine">The Atlantic</i>, 19.02.2014.
          <br />In one of the scenes that made the film <i class="film">Dead Poets Society</i> famous,
          English teacher John Keating lets his students rip out the introduction the introducion to their poetry book
          because he wants them to think for themselves. What he really does, however,
          is replacing critical reading with &ldquo;appreciation&rdquo; and
          instead of teaching his students to <q>look at things in a different way</q>,
          he merely teaches his own &ldquo;different way&rdquo;.
          According to Dettmar, Keating represents what he calls “sentimental humanities”:
          <q>humanities content stripped of all humanities methodology and rigor</q>;
          this reductive view is damaging to the humanities.
          (Dettmar also points out that Keating misreads the poems he teaches.)
          <br />Dettmar challenges the misconception that humanities doesnt't train thinkers;
          instead: <q>To read literature well is to be challenged, and to emerge changed.</q>
          He links to examples of neuroscience that also point in this direction.
          (See
          <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/september/austen-reading-fmri-090712.html">This is your brain on Jane Austen, and Stanford researchers are taking notes</a>,
          Stanford News, 07.09.2012, and
          <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/01/study-reading-a-novel-changes-your-brain/282952/"><!--@@check title-->Reading a Novel Changes Your Brain</a>
          <i class="magazine">The Atlantic</i>, January 2014.)
          On the other hand, the humanities turned to theory in the 1970 and 1980s,
          a development that was accompanied by politicization.
          This politicization led to a backlash; some people don't want the humanities to be too intellectual.
        </li>
        <li>Waurechen, Sarah:
          <a href="https://sarahwaurechen.wordpress.com/2014/03/17/picking-apart-the-vision-of-humanistic-teaching-and-learning-in-dead-poets-society/">Picking Apart the Vision of Humanistic Teaching and Learning in Dead Poet’s Society</a>,
          <i class="blog"><abbr>Ph.D.</abbr>s and Pedagogy</i>, 17.03.2014.
          <br />Sarah Waurechen partly agrees with Dettmar's criticism but adds that
          <q>Dettmar is misreading the film as badly as Keating misreads all that poetry</q>.
          She thinks the film critiques <q>the carefree, youthful romance with a smattering of dead poets</q>.
          Early in the film, Keating questions the limitations of freedom:
          <q>But only in their dreams can men be truly free. ‘Twas always thus, and always thus will be.</q>
          However, she admits that Keating's way of encouraging non-conformity made her uncomfortable.
          The students should at least learn to understand what they rebel against and that Keating does not help them:
          <q>They must become the self-aware and critical beings that Keating briefly gestures towards and then ignores.</q>
          <br />In the film's final scene, half of the students remain seated:
          <q>the choice to stand becomes more individual and more critical</q>.
          For Waurechen,
          <q>the movie is indeed an excellent defense of the Humanities,
          if you can watch it with enough of a critical eye to see that it’s not Keating who embodies true learning</q>.
        </li>
        <li>Berkson, David:
          <a href="http://thepigeonpress.org/dead-poets-society-pedagogy-sentimentality-uncritical-thinking/">Dead Poets Society: The Pedagogy of Sentimentality and Uncritical Thinking</a>,
          <i class="website">The Pigeon Press</i>, 03.11.2017.
          <br />According to the author, <i class="film">Dead Poets Society</i>
          <q>corrupts the pedagogical principles it smugly purports to champion</q>.
          The film protrays John Keating as a phenomenal and progressive teacher, whereas in reality he is a bad teacher.
          First, there isn't much direct interplay between teacher and students except for the &ldquo;barbaric yawp&rdquo; scene;
          Keating is too much of a stand-up comedian.
          Second, Keating has no interest in critical thinking.
          When he instructs his students to rip the introduction out of their poetry textbook,
          the message is <q>analysis leads to conformity, and conformity is bad</q>.
          He never asks what his students think of the introduction, in spite of saying,
          <q>Now when you read, don’t just consider what the author thinks, consider what <em>you</em> think.</q>
          Third, Keating is an egomaniac: he tells his students to address him as
          &ldquo;O Captain! my Captain!&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Mr. Keating&rdquo;,
          implicitly comparing himself to Abraham Lincoln.
          In the film's final scene, the students clearly express their allegiance to him.
          Keating is also a coward; when he thinks his job is at stake, he reprimands Charlie Dalton
          for putting his &ldquo;carpe diem&rdquo; and his anti-authoritarian views into practice.
          Neil Perry doesn't get any support from him, either.
          Finally, the film eroticises Neil Perry's suicide.
          Berkson concludes that <i class="film">Dead Poets Society</i>
          <q>a morally bankrupt piece of emotional pornography, profoundly smug, deeply irresponsible, and ill-deserving of its many accolades</q>.

          <i class="blog">The Over-Educated Negro</i>, 13.02.2015.
          <br />This blog post is not primarily about <i class="film">Dead Poets Society</i>.
          Porter writes:
          <q><i class="film">Dead Poets Society</i> is about stimulating an enthusiasm for reading and learning in high school kids,
          whereas <i class="film">Wit</i> is about sharpening and refining those sensibilities
          into rigorous scholarship at the college level. Perhaps.</q>

          <br />This author also finds the film <q>weirdly anti-intellectual</q> and adds that
          <q>given our current political climate, it’s not super fun to watch
          a high school teacher essentially tell his students that the truth is whatever you feel is true.</q>

          is a YouTube playlist created by Tim Nance. It contains a handful of videos that introduces
          major types of literary criticism (New Criticism, Reader Response, Historical Criticism, etcetera).
        </li>
        <li>Marc Baldwin:
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmRMjCfLEtA">The Basics of Literary Criticism</a> (13 minutes) and
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6ixulYPtYg">The Major Theories of Literary Criticism</a> (22 minutes)
          are two short lectures.
          In the first video, Marc Baldwin says,
          <q>I've noticed through the years that when many of my students don't like a work of literature or they call it boring,
          what they really mean is that they didn't fully appreciate what the writer was doing. They didn't really understand the work.
          Having a grounding in critical theory can help you better understand and appreciate what you're reading.</q>

          is a series of 26 videos that gives an overview of twentieth-century literary criticism.
          They are based on a series of lectures recorded in 2009 at Yale University
          (see the description on <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300">Open Yale courses</a>).
          Each video is between 40 and 55 minutes long.

      <p>People sometimes ask why we need literary theory. Here is one answer (posted on a mailing list in 18 September 1995):</p>
      <blockquote><p>My short (perhaps equally naive) answer to a very complex question is
        that literary theory (<abbr>l.t.</abbr>) is a body of (more or less coherent)
        assumptions about what literature is, how and why to read and study it.
        These very general theoretical postulates can then be applied to/on
        different levels of the study of literature.</p>
      <p>Looking at it in practical terms, literary theory more or less tries to
        theorize and systematize the conceptual frameworks shared by different
        (Western) literatures, like "poetic language", "poetry", "sonnet",
        "novel", "stream of consciousness", "metre", "character", "Modernism",
        "literary period", "literary history", "interpretation", etc.

      </blockquote>
      <p>Here is another point of view, from the blurb of Catherine Belsey's book
        <i class="booktitle">Shakespeare in Theory and Practice</i> (Edinburgh University Press, 2010):
      </p>
      <blockquote><p>Theory is valuable to the degree that it enables us to read differently:
        a nuanced approach shows that the most obvious interpretation is never the whole story.</p>

          <q cite="https://youtu.be/CHxhjDPKfbY?t=402">Don't keep anything in your head for the rest of your life. That's going to feel unnatural, awkward and unnecessary.
          <strong>Every single thing you're committed to finish that takes more than on step to finish it, you need to clarify exactly what that outcome and project is
          and put that on a project list that you look at, at least once a week.</strong>
          Every single next action you need to take about any of your commitments that you are involved in, you need to clarify and park those in appropriate places
          so that you are going to see those actions on a regular basis.</q>

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel">The School of Life</a>
          is a YouTube channel started by people who are
          <q cite="https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel/about">fascinated
          by the sort of questions we're never taught enough about at school or college:
          How can relationships go well? What is meaningful work? How can love last?
          How can one find calm? What's gone wrong (and right) with capitalism?</q>
          The makers of this channel also say,
          <q>We love the humanities, especially philosophy, psychotherapy, literature and art -
          always going to them in search of ideas that are thought-provoking, useful and consoling.</q>
          The channel started in September 2014; the videos are typically between
          2 and 10 minutes long.<br />
          The YouTube channel is only part of this initiative. See also

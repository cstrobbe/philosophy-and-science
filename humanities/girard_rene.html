    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><span lang="fr">René Girard</span> (1923-2015) was a French literary critic and philosopher 
      whose work is not always easy to categorise. 
      In addition to literature and philosophy, his work is also relevant philosophical anthropology, 
      psychology and economics (although he did not publish in all these areas).
      His work is based on the analysis of literary and religious texts, not on 
      actual research in psychology or anthropology (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> no field research).
    </p>
    <p>
      After writing a <abbr>PhD</abbr> dissertation in history, he moved from France to the United States,
      where his first journal articles focused on French literature. 
      In his first book, <i class="booktitle" lang="fr">Mensonge romantique et vérité romanesque</i> (1961),
      he first formulated his theory about <em>mimetic desire</em>, based on an analysis
      of novels by Cervantes, Flaubert, Stenhal, Proust and Dostoyevski.
      His second major work, <i class="booktitle" lang="fr">La Violence et le sacré</i> (1972)
      is the consequence of thinking through the consequences of mimesis for early human societies.
      This led to the formulation of his theory about the role of the <em>scapegoat mechanism</em> in the 
      emergence of human culture and religion.
      His 1978 book <i class="booktitle" lang="fr">Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde</i> (1978)
      continued his work in this direction and added his theory that the 
      Bible reveals and denounces the scapegoat mechanism.
      Several other books followed, including 
      <i class="booktitle" lang="fr">La route antique des hommes pervers</i> (1985),
      which focuses on the book of Job, and
      <i class="booktitle">A Theatre of Envy: William Shakespeare</i> (1991),
      in which he shows that Shakespeare was aware of the mechanisms of mimesis
      and scapegoating.

  <p>Someone asked on Literature Stack Exchange,
    <a href="https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/11635/2191">What is the origin of the trope of an evil character whose name is not permitted to be spoken?</a>
    The full question goes as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Many works of fantasy involve an evil leader or "dark lord" whose real name is known but usually not permitted to be spoken, either by his own followers (out of respect?) or by others (out of fear?) or both.</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>In the Wheel of Time series, the Dark One's true name is Shai'tan, but nobody uses the name, either Darkfriends or good people, for fear of attracting unwanted attention from him.</li>
    <li>In the Harry Potter series, Voldemort is referred to by such names as You-Know-Who, He Who Must Not Be Named, or (by his followers) the Dark Lord.</li>
    <li>In the Lord of the Rings, Sauron does not permit his name to be used by his followers. (I'm not exactly sure why and <a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/218155/31394">have asked a related question about that</a>.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>What is the origin of this trope?</strong> Many fantasy tropes spring originally from Tolkien, but this one feels older. It feels similar to the Jewish belief that one must not speak the name of God, although different because this is specifically about evil characters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan" rel="noreferrer">I couldn't find any analogous belief about Satan in any major religion</a>, but my gut feeling says this idea might well come from real-world religion or mythology rather than being a thing purely of fantasy literature.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Several people posted comments on the question, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Speak of the devil, and he appears. – <a href="https://literature.stackexchange.com/users/254/obie-2-0">Obie 2.0</a><!-- https://literature.stackexchange.com/users/254/obie-2-0 -->
    </li>
    <li>@Obie2.0 Good catch; I hadn't thought about that phrase and its literal meaning, since nowadays it's so often used metaphorically.
      Looking it up, though, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_of_the_devil">the Wikipedia page</a> is full of "citation needed" or equivalent.
      So you've found an origin in popular folklore, but then the question becomes, where did <em>that</em> come from? – <a href="https://literature.stackexchange.com/users/17/rand-althor">Rand al'Thor</a><!-- https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/11635/what-is-the-origin-of-the-trope-of-an-evil-character-whose-name-is-not-permitted/11650#comment18810_11635 -->
    </li>
    <li>See <b>naming taboos</b>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_taboo" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_taboo</a>.  – <a href="https://literature.stackexchange.com/users/7386/taliesinmerlin">TaliesinMerlin</a><!-- https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/11635/what-is-the-origin-of-the-trope-of-an-evil-character-whose-name-is-not-permitted/11650#comment18818_11635 --></li>
    <li>@TaliesinMerlin Interesting, but I'm not sure if the taboo against naming Chinese emperors is really an instance of the same thing? I guess it depends on your point of view, since the trope I'm thinking of relates specifically to evil characters. – Rand al'Thor</li>

  <hr />

  <p>Below is an answer, not necessarily <em>the</em> answer, to that question.</p>

  <p>As Obie pointed out in a comment, the expression <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_of_the_devil" rel="nofollow noreferrer">speak of the devil and he shall appear</a> is a remnant of a naming taboo that was taken very seriously in days long gone. Religions have known many more naming taboos. The Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Judaism" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Names of God in Judaism</a> points out that most English editions of the Bible use the phrase "the Lord", "owing to the Jewish tradition increasingly viewing the divine name as too sacred to be uttered." (See also <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1443443/jewish/Why-Dont-Jews-Say-Gds-Name.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Why Don’t Jews Say G‑d’s Name?</a>.) In imperial China, there <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_taboo" rel="nofollow noreferrer">was a taboo on using the emperor's name</a>. Somewhat similar is the prohibition against creating images of a god (or of living beings in general), notably in Islam. See for example the article <a href="https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/cultural-history-themes/image-prohibition" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Religious Prohibition Against Images</a>, which quotes the Sahih Muslim hadith:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>He who creates pictures in this world will be ordered to breathe life into them on the Day of Judgment, but he will be unable to do so.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Finding the origin of such prohibitions, requires a theory about the origin of religion generally, and I don't believe there is a consensus about this topic in anthropology. One theory that is capable of explaining the above is the one proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard" rel="nofollow noreferrer">René Girard</a> (1923 – 2015), especially in his works <em>La Violence et le sacré</em> (1972; English: <a href="https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/violence-and-sacred" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Violence and the Sacred</em></a>) and <em>Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde</em> (1978; English: <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=2670" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World</em></a>). I can only give an extremely condensed summary of his theory here.</p>
  
  <p>In his earliest works, René Girard had explained that the human capacity to imitate ("mimesis") does not only help us learn things (see <a href="http://newlearningonline.com/new-learning/chapter-8/aristotle-on-mimesis" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Aristotle's view on mimesis</a>) but that it can also lead to conflict when one individual imitates another's desire for something. In <em>Mensonge romantique et vérité romanesque</em> (1961) Girard analysed a number of novels that exposed the romantic lie that our wishes and desires are entirely original and that show them to be the result of imitation. Some of these novels also described sophisticated ways of dealing with mimetic rivals.</p>
  
  <p>Next, Girard asked what this insuppressible tendency to imitate would have meant for early human culture. The increase in brain size during the evolution from primates to hominids did not only imply a greater capacity to learn but also a potential increase in mimetic conflicts. Looking at a wide range of myths and religions, Girard used a process that may be described as abductive inference to arrive at the following hypothesis:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Mimetic conflicts could escalate until they involved the entire group. This conflict of all against all could only end if one individual died as the result of this <strong>collective violence</strong>. Since the death of this individual brought back peace, this individual became associated with both the power to bring this peace and with the power to bring the preceding collective violence. This individual possessed nothing less than a <strong>godlike power</strong>. This process must have repeated itself many times until early hominids developed way of dealing with this, as described below.</li>
  <li>In the collective conflict described above, social and other differences within the group seem to disappear. This could lead to an association between the <strong>absence/disappearance of differences</strong> and social conflict, and hence a fear of an absence of differences. One example of this are myths in which one brother kills his twin and thereby establishes a new order, e.g. the mythical founding of Rome is based on Romulus killing his brother Remus.</li>
  <li>Ancient religious practices originate from an effort to deal with the collective violence. For example, instead of waiting for the next collective conflict, the community choses an individual and collectively kills it. The victim is strictly speaking innocent, but the <strong>collective murder</strong> turns him into the godlike individual that can cause violence and bring back peace. It is essential that the entire community believes in the victim's guilt, otherwise his death cannot bring peace because it would trigger revenge killings and more violence. Myths describing the death of individuals who brought certain things or benefits into the world leave no doubt about the victim's guilt.</li>
  <li>Since the sacrificed individual has dangerous powers, it makes sense to delegate this sacrifice to one or more individuals, who thus become <strong>"priests"</strong>.</li>
  <li>Since the collective violence mentioned above is associated with all sorts of transgessions, it makes sense to delay the sacrifice of the chosen victim in order to allow or force him to violate all sorts of social rules (rules that would lead to collective violence if everyone violated them). This individual violates what some cultures call <strong>"taboo"</strong> and thereby establishes his guilt and justifies his sacrifice at the hands of the community or the priests.</li>
  <li>The chosen individual is associated with the power to bring violence, and hence is very dangerous. If he manages to exploit the fear he causes, he may be able to delay the sacrifice, stay alive and become a <strong>"god-king"</strong>. This would be the origin of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_king" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sacred kingship</a>. Based on Girard's theory, it is no coincidence that kings were often considered as gods or their intermediaries (e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Egyptian pharaohs</a>).</li>
  <li>The meaning of the godlike victim was always <strong>ambiguous</strong>, i.e. having power over both peace and violence. This would explain why some languages have words that can mean both "sacred" and "cursed", e.g. the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sacer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Latin word <em>sacer</em></a>. (The same ambiguity is still present in the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sacr%C3%A9" rel="nofollow noreferrer">French adjective <em>sacré</em></a>.) However, this ambiguity is difficult to tolerate in the long run, so cultures must either find excuses why "good gods" sometimes do bad things or make a distinction between "good gods" and "devils" (in Christian culture, Satan is a fallen angel). </li>
  <li>Early hominids seem not to have distinguished clearly (or not always) between <strong>a thing and its name</strong>. This would also apply to the godlike individual or victim mentioned above and hence also to kings. This would have given rise to <strong>naming taboos</strong>, which can apply both to "good gods" and "devils". It would expain why "the divine name [was] too sacred to be uttered" (to quote the Wikipedia article about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Judaism" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Names of God in Judaism</a> again).</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The above theory does not explain the origin of all religions; it is a theory about religious practices that emerged as a result psycho-social mechanisms, not about religions that have a historical "founding father", e.g. Christianity, Islam and Buddhism. However, it is possible that these newer religions incorporated ancient beliefs and taboos instead of replacing them entirely. In addition, Girard also describes how the Old Testament subverts the belief in the guilt of the sacrificial victim. For example, the myth about Romulus and Remus is very similar to the story of Cain and Abel, but with an important difference: the God of the Old Testament does not let Cain get away with Abel's murder.

        is a short video by The School of Life. The video explains that
        philosophy is relevant to us because 
        we&mdash;&ldquo;normal people&rdquo;&mdash;don't 
        ask big questions, are vulnerable to errors of common sense,
        are mentally confused, have muddled ideas about what makes us happy, and
        panic and lose perspective.

        analytical skills and verbal reasoning) but that is not the most important
        benefit: 
        <strong><q cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kYKF3IAwyw&t=1m34s">the

        and advocates the inclusion of philosophy in primary school curricula.
        Takeaway quote:
        <q>Studying philosophy cultivates doubt without helplessness, and confidence without hubris. 
        I’ve watched kids evolve to be more rational, sceptical and open-minded, and I’ve seen them interact in more fair-minded and collaborative ways.
        As one 10-year-old said, <q>I’ve started to actually solve arguments and problems with philosophy. And it works better than violence or anything else.</q></q>

        It quotes philosophy professor Paul Boghossian, who says that a philosophy

        The article also contains a wonderful quote from Alex Pozdnyakov, 
        an immigrant from Russia, who explains why he wanted to study philosophy before
        tackling his final field of study:
        <q>I have this strange phrase I use when people ask me why I chose philosophy.
        I tell them that I wanted to become a professional human being before becoming a professional. 
        I thought philosophy would give me that and it did.</q>

        philosophers know. <span lang="de">Schnädelbach</span> tries to 
        summarise this knowledge in a fairly accessible way. (However, the book 
        is not a very easy read and assumes some knowledge of the history of 
        philosophy.) Each chapter presents quite a lot of historical background 
        to introduce something that philosophers &ldquo;know&rdquo;. 
        In some cases, this knowledge comes down to &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; that 
        certain ideas are <strong>not</strong> valid.

        Philosophy is unable to explain the nature of humanity, so this task falls to science.
        Wilson mentions five scientific disciplines that are making progress in this area:
        evolutionary biology, paleontology &amp; archeology (considered as a single discipline, but each looking at different timescales),
        brain science, artificial intelligence research, and robotics.

      be found in the writings of both philosophers and scientsts:

        <i class="journal">Essays in Philosophy</i>, 12.2 (July 2011: Philosophy's Future: Science or Something Else?).
        <br />According to Dietrich, philosophy still deals with the same questions as 2500 years ago. 
        Philosophy <q>morphs and transforms to stay current</q>: ideas and theories are reformulated in modern language, but that is all the progress there is.
        Philosophical theories that are definitely contradictory are equally plausible. 
        Dietrich even argues that philosophy will never be able to solve any philosophical problems.

        It doesn't tell us anything. It doesn't produce knowledge, or truth.</q>
        To those who claim that science cannot investigate the supernatural, he responds that scientists
        <q> routinely apply the scientific way of knowing to questions about the supernatural. Does prayer work? Is their any evidence for life after death?</q>
        and that 
        <q>[t]he scientific way of knowing is quite capable of discovering something that conflicts with or violates natural causes. So far, nothing has turned up but that doesn't mean we've never tried looking.</q>
        Moran thinks that philosophers simply made up the claim that science cannot investigate
        the supernatural to protect both religion and philosophy from science.

            Martin Cothran says that philosophy discovered the following true knowledge:
            The Law of Identity, the Law of Excluded Middle, the Law of Non-Contradiction, the existence and distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous terms, the distinction between contradictory, contrary, subcontrary and subalternate statements, and the rules for logical validity...

            kevin says: "Gottlob Frege, in his philosophical work, discovered/developed quite a few significant problems that a theory of the semantic value of names would have to solve. Similarly, Tarski's development of the notion of a metalanguage, and a system of formal semantics is something that was primarily motivated by philosophical investigation."
            "More recent philosophical work that makes definite contributions to knowledge about language and the world includes Hannes Leitgeb's work on semantic dependence, Hartry Field's work on nominalizing mathematical language for sections of physics (showing that we could replace reference to platonistic entities with purely physical entities for parts of science), and Volker Halbach's work on the properties of axiomatic theories of truth."

    <h2>Professional or Academic Philosophy</h2>
    <p>During the 19th century, philosophy became a discipline that was mainly
      practiced at universities. At the same time, it also became both much more technical and 
      less relevant to the world outside academia.
      Some philosophers have voiced criticism against this trend.

        <br />This text argues that academic philosophy is constantly dominated by a specific &ldquo;core&rdquo;
        and that anyone who wants to make a career as an academic philosopher 
        must stick to the disciplines and basic ideas that constitute that core. 
        (It is not clear whether this problem is equally severe outside North America.)
        The manifesto cites a paper by David Bourget and David J. Chalmers:

    <h2>Epistemology</h2>
    <p>Since scientific knowledge is a type of knowledge, epistemology <em>should</em> be relevant to
      philosophy of science (even though both disciplines appear to evolve independently, according to Marko Beljac). 
      One of the problems of epistemology that appears especially relevant to philosophy of science is the
      Gettier problem.

        class="booktitle">Intellectual Impostures</a>, 1998),
        in which they criticised the strange notions that some
        twentieth-century philosophers hold (or held) about science.

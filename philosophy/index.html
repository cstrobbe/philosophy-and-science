        The article also contains a wonderful quote from Alex Pozdnyakov, 
        an immigrant from Russia, who explains why he wanted to study philosophy before
        tackling his final field of study:
        <q>I have this strange phrase I use when people ask me why I chose philosophy.
        I tell them that I wanted to become a professional human being before becoming a professional.

        <span lang="en">This book counters the idea that philosophy makes no 
        progress by pointing out that introductory courses in philosophy have a 
        lot of content in common, so there is an implicit consensus on what 
        philosophers know. <span lang="de">Schnädelbach</span> tries to 
        summarise this knowledge in a fairly accessible way. (However, the book 
        is not a very easy read and assumes some knowledge of the history of 
        philosophy.) Each chapter presents quite a lot of historical background 
        to introduce something that philosophers &ldquo;know&rdquo;. 
        In some cases, this knowledge comes down to &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; that 
        certain ideas are <strong>not</strong> valid.

        To those who claim that science cannot investigate the supernatural, he responds that scientists
        <q> routinely apply the scientific way of knowing to questions about the supernatural. Does prayer work? Is their any evidence for life after death?</q>
        and that 
        <q>[t]he scientific way of knowing is quite capable of discovering something that conflicts with or violates natural causes. So far, nothing has turned up but that doesn't mean we've never tried looking.</q>
        Moran thinks that philosophers simply made up the claim that science cannot investigate
        the supernatural to protect both religion and philosophy from science.

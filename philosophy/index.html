        <span lang="en">This book counters the idea that philosophy makes no 
        progress by pointing out that introductory courses in philosophy have a 
        lot of content in common, so there is an implicit consensus on what 
        philosophers know. <span lang="de">SchnÃ¤delbach</span> tries to 
        summarise this knowledge in a fairly accessible way. (However, the book 
        is not a very easy read and assumes some knowledge of the history of 
        philosophy.) Each chapter presents quite a lot of historical background 
        to introduce something that philosophers &ldquo;know&rdquo;. 
        In some cases, this knowledge comes down to &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; that 
        certain ideas are <strong>not</strong> valid.

        <br />According to Dietrich, philosophy still deals with the same questions as 2500 years ago. 
        Philosophy <q>morphs and transforms to stay current</q>: ideas and theories are reformulated in modern language, but that is all the progress there is.
        Philosophical theories that are definitely contradictory are equally plausible. 
        Dietrich even argues that philosophy will never be able to solve any philosophical problems.

        the tentative conclusion that much of what passes for modern philosophy is a house of cards. 
        It doesn't tell us anything. It doesn't produce knowledge, or truth.</q>
        To those who claim that science cannot investigate the supernatural, he responds that scientists
        <q> routinely apply the scientific way of knowing to questions about the supernatural. Does prayer work? Is their any evidence for life after death?</q>
        and that 
        <q>[t]he scientific way of knowing is quite capable of discovering something that conflicts with or violates natural causes. So far, nothing has turned up but that doesn't mean we've never tried looking.</q>
        Moran thinks that philosophers simply made up the claim that science cannot investigate
        the supernatural to protect both religion and philosophy from science.

            Martin Cothran says that philosophy discovered the following true knowledge:
            The Law of Identity, the Law of Excluded Middle, the Law of Non-Contradiction, the existence and distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous terms, the distinction between contradictory, contrary, subcontrary and subalternate statements, and the rules for logical validity...

            kevin says: "Gottlob Frege, in his philosophical work, discovered/developed quite a few significant problems that a theory of the semantic value of names would have to solve. Similarly, Tarski's development of the notion of a metalanguage, and a system of formal semantics is something that was primarily motivated by philosophical investigation."
            "More recent philosophical work that makes definite contributions to knowledge about language and the world includes Hannes Leitgeb's work on semantic dependence, Hartry Field's work on nominalizing mathematical language for sections of physics (showing that we could replace reference to platonistic entities with purely physical entities for parts of science), and Volker Halbach's work on the properties of axiomatic theories of truth."

    <h2>The Humanities</h2>
    <p>Editorial note: this section will probably move to a separate page.</p>
    <p>The English language makes a distinction between &ldquo;science&rdquo;
      and the &ldquo;humanities&rdquo;, thereby implying that the humanities
      are not true sciences.
      This opposition is often expressed as a distinction between 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science">hard and
      soft science</a> or, as in C. P. Snow's famous book,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures" 
      class="booktitle">The Two Cultures</a> (1959).
      Other languages do not make this distinction and
      give the study of literature, linguistics, music <abbr>etc.</abbr>
      names that include a word for science. These disciplines are collectively
      known as
      <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisteswissenschaft" 
      lang="de">Geisteswissenschaft(en)</a> in German,
      <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanidades"
      lang="es">humanidades</a> in Spanish and
      <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfawetenschappen"
      lang="nl">alfawetenschappen</a> in Dutch.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>The humanities (which are usually considered to include philosophy) 
      have come under pressure after sciences like physics became
      the model for scientific progress in general.
      A recent example is the 
      <a href="http://savemdxphil.com/about/">closing of the Philosophy
      Department at Middlesex University</a>.
      Some people have reacted to this by pointing out the value
      of the humanities to society.
      The British philosopher 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._C._Grayling">A. C. Grayling</a>
      responded by founding the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College_of_the_Humanities">New
      College of the Humanities</a> in London, which started offering tuition
      in 2012.

        to reduce the stunning complexity of the past to identity and class
        politics</q>.
